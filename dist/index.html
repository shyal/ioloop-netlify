    <H1>ioloopco UK shutting down.</H1>
    <p>It is with a heavy heart that I announce the closure of ioloopco ltd.</p>
    <p>ioloopco started trading in 2016, and it was an exciting 4 years, filled with truely interesting people and projects.</p>
    <h1>Partners</h1>
    <p>During its time, i had the pleasure of working with companies in the startup arena, in the tech consultancy sector, in Visual Effects, and in the Medical Implants sector.</p>
    <p>This broad variety has allowed me to meet entrepreneurial, creative and very talented individuals from all walks of life; and for that i am thankful.</p>
    <h1>Reasons for shutting down</h1>
    <h2>Brexit</h2>
    <p>Brexit was first announced while i was contracting from Spain, via a London-based limited company (ioloopco), for a French client.</p>
    <p>The results of the referendum came as an absolute shock. ioloopco was registered in the UK, but with the firm intent of dealing with clients thoughout europe.</p>
    <h2>COVID19 handling</h2>
    <p>The response from the UK goverment to the COVID19 outbreak was driven by politics, and not by science. As such i am no longer convinced Britain is an optimal location from which to operate.</p>
